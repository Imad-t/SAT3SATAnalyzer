SAT3SATAnalyzer is a comprehensive toolkit designed to solve and analyze Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) and their specialized 3-SAT variants.
This project includes:

SAT Solver: An efficient algorithm to determine the satisfiability of general SAT instances.

3-SAT Solver: A solver tailored for problems in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with exactly three literals per clause.

SAT to 3-SAT Reduction: A linear-time reduction algorithm to transform general SAT instances into equivalent 3-SAT forms while preserving satisfiability.

Solution Verification: Tools to validate proposed solutions for SAT and 3-SAT problems.

Empirical Analysis: Performance profiling of algorithms, with insights into time and space complexity through experimentation on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, SAT3SATAnalyzer provides everything you need to tackle satisfiability problems efficiently and gain deep insights into their computational complexity.
